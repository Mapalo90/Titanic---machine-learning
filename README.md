# Titanic---machine-learning

In this project, we are given a data set comprising of information about the people who boarded the Titanic ship. The information is important as it provides data about the people that survived and those that did not. Therefore, details concerning the the people that boarded this ship in 1912 can be seen in this data. The data can be downloaded from the kaggle website.

The data shows that the sample size for people that boarded the Titanic were 891 and the total number was 2224 and that the survivor rates depended on different factors, for example sex and passenger class. This means that the likelihood for survivor to those in the first class may have been higher than those in the third class or that survivor rates may have depended on the persons sex. Therefore, the challenge given here involves developing a prediction model for surivor rates of passengers that boarded the Titanic Ship using factors given below:

Name (str) - Name of the passenger
Pclass (int) - Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Sex (str) - Gender of the passenger
Age (float) - Age in years
SibSp (int) - Number of siblings and spouses aboard
Parch (int) - Number of parents and children aboard
Ticket (str) - Ticket number
Fare (float) - Passenger fare
Cabin (str) - Cabin number
Embarked (str) - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
